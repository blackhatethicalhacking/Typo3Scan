## Version 0.3.3

* Extensions are now saved into different files, separated by state (experimental | alpha | beta | stable | outdated | all). This makes it possible to check more specific ones.

## Version 0.3.2

* Added support for Windows and Red Hat systems

## Version 0.3.1

* It is now possible to check for specific extensions (-e or --extension).
* Domains must be specified with 'http://' or 'https://'.
* Login page redirections can be followed or not.
* Fixed the 'all extensions are installed' bug in the summary when using verbose mode.
* Set sleep between threads to 0.5 to fix time out errors when checking a huge amount of extensions.

## Version 0.3

* Using modules instead of one class
* Accepting now strg+c when in multi-threaded mode
* Update function will now generate a list with extensions instead of an xml. This list is sorted by default (download count). Loading this file is much faster than parsing the xml everytime.
* It is now possible to use only TOR, Privoxy, or TOR with Privoxy (in order to prevent DNS leakage).
* Max. threads are set to 10 to prevent connection issues and DoS, default threads are now 7.
* Connection timeout can be set with '--timeout VALUE'. Default is 20.
* Verbose mode lists also not installed extensions (but trust me, you donÂ´t want to scroll through over 6400 entries).
* Typo3 version search is more accurate
* If the backend login page could not be found, but Typo3 is used, the user is asked, if he want to proceed. This will mostly lead to "no extensions are installed".
